# 👋 Welcome

I'm a Security Researcher with a background in cyber incident response and threat detection.  
Previously, I worked as a Sr. Cyber Security Analyst in the banking sector, where I led both detection engineering and purple team initiatives — bridging offensive insights with defensive strategy.

Currently, I'm focused on Smart Contract Security — identifying vulnerabilities, writing exploits, and building end-to-end security case studies in Web3.
